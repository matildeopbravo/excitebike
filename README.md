# Excite Bike 
##### LI1 Project

This game is a Haskell-written version of the well-known Nintendo Game: **Excite Bike**.

A classmate and I made this project for the subject of "Laboratórios de Informática I" (LI1) throughout the first semester.

## How to run the game (UNIX):

The main file is called `Tarefa5_2019li1g161.hs`. In order to compile the code and generate the executable file you must run the following command:
``` ghc Tarefa5_2019li1g161.hs -o ExciteBike ```

Now, you just need to run the executable like so: 
``` ./ExciteBike ```
